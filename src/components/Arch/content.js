    title: "What is Arch Linux?",
    content: `
      Arch Linux is a lightweight, flexible, and minimalist Linux distribution aimed at experienced users who seek control over every aspect of their system. 
      Initially released in 2002, Arch follows the principle of simplicity, focusing on a "do-it-yourself" approach that allows users to build and configure their system exactly as they need.
      Unlike many other distributions, Arch does not provide a default desktop environment or pre-installed software, giving users complete freedom to shape their system.

    title: "Philosophy of Arch Linux",
    content: `
      Arch Linux operates under the principle of "Keep It Simple, Stupid" (KISS), meaning it strives to be as simple as possible but no simpler. This simplicity translates into:
      - Minimalism: The base installation includes only the essential components, and users choose what additional software to install.
      - Transparency: Arch avoids hiding configurations behind graphical interfaces, encouraging users to learn the underlying system processes.
      - User Control: Users have complete freedom to install, configure, and modify the system as they see fit, making Arch highly customizable.

    title: "Arch Linux Installation Process",
    content: `
      Unlike most Linux distributions, Arch Linux does not have a graphical installer. Instead, users install it via a command-line process, following a set of steps outlined in the Arch Wiki.
      - **Base Installation**: Users start by installing only the base system, and then manually add software, drivers, and any other necessary components.
      - **Configuration**: Users configure every element, including disk partitioning, file systems, network settings, and the kernel.
      - **Learning Opportunity**: This manual setup provides a valuable learning experience for users, teaching them the fundamentals of Linux in the process.

    title: "Package Management",
    content: `
      Arch Linux's package management system revolves around:
      - **Pacman**: Arch’s default package manager, which simplifies managing packages, updating the system, and installing dependencies through a fast, easy-to-use command-line interface.
      - **Rolling Release Model**: Users continuously receive the latest software updates without needing to reinstall or upgrade the system.
      - **Arch User Repository (AUR)**: A vast, community-maintained repository that provides access to thousands of third-party applications. The AUR allows users to access software not found in the official repositories, making Arch highly versatile.
